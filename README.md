_The oxygen saturation level in the blood (SaO<sub>2</sub>) is crucial for health, particularly in relation to sleep-related breathing disorders. However, continuous monitoring of SaO<sub>2</sub> is time-consuming and highly variable depending on patients' conditions. Recently, optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) has shown promising development in rapidly and effectively screening eye-related lesions, offering the potential for diagnosing sleep-related disorders. To bridge this gap, our paper presents three key contributions. Firstly, we propose <b>JointViT</b>, a novel model based on the Vision Transformer architecture, incorporating a <b>joint loss</b> function for supervision. Secondly, we introduce a <b>balancing augmentation</b> technique during data preprocessing to improve the model's performance, particularly on the long-tail distribution within the OCTA dataset. Lastly, through comprehensive experiments on the OCTA dataset, our proposed method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements of up to <b>12.28%</b> in overall accuracy. This advancement lays the groundwork for the future utilization of OCTA in diagnosing sleep-related disorders._
